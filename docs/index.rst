Introduction
------------

**pollywog** is a Python library designed to make it easy to build, manipulate, and visually inspect Leapfrog-style calculation sets‚Äîespecially when those sets are large, complex, or involve repetitive logic.

What is Leapfrog?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Leapfrog <https://www.seequent.com/products-solutions/leapfrog-geo/>`_ is industry-leading 3D geological modeling and mine planning software developed by Seequent. It is widely used in mining and resource estimation for:

- **Drillhole database management** and visualization
- **Geological modeling** (surfaces, solids, block models)
- **Grade estimation** (kriging, IDW, nearest neighbor)
- **Resource and reserve calculation**
- **Mine planning and design**

Leapfrog uses **calculation sets** (``.lfcalc`` files) to define formulas and transformations applied to data. These calculations can become complex when dealing with multiple domains, conditional logic, and multi-commodity resources.

Why pollywog?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Problems pollywog solves:**

   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Challenge
     - Solution
   * - üìù **Large calculation sets**
     - Generate hundreds of calculations programmatically instead of point-and-click
   * - üîÄ **Complex logic**
     - Use Python's control flow (loops, conditionals) to build calculations
   * - üîÅ **Repetitive tasks**
     - Automate patterns with helper functions and templates
   * - üîç **Hard to review**
     - Display calculation trees interactively in Jupyter notebooks
   * - ü§ñ **ML integration**
     - Deploy scikit-learn models directly as Leapfrog calculations
   * - üìã **Version control**
     - Keep calculation logic in Git-trackable Python scripts
   * - üß™ **Testing**
     - Write unit tests for calculation logic before deploying

**By using pollywog, you can:**

- ‚úÖ Automate creation and modification of calculation sets
- ‚úÖ Refactor and query calculations with code
- ‚úÖ Export directly to Leapfrog ``.lfcalc`` format
- ‚úÖ Visualize and validate logic interactively
- ‚úÖ Deploy machine learning models in resource models
- ‚úÖ Maintain calculation logic in version-controlled scripts

Quick Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a simple example showing pollywog's power ‚Äì creating a complete resource estimation postprocessing workflow in just a few lines:

.. code-block:: python

    from pollywog.core import CalcSet, Number
    from pollywog.helpers import WeightedAverage, CategoryFromThresholds
    
    # Build a complete calculation set
    calcset = CalcSet([
        # 1. Weighted average across geological domains
        WeightedAverage(
            variables=["Au_oxide", "Au_sulfide", "Au_transition"],
            weights=["prop_oxide", "prop_sulfide", "prop_transition"],
            name="Au_composite",
            comment="Domain-weighted gold grade"
        ),
        
        # 2. Apply dilution and recovery
        Number(name="Au_diluted", children=["[Au_composite] * 0.95"],
               comment_equation="5% dilution factor"),
        Number(name="Au_recovered", children=["[Au_diluted] * 0.88"],
               comment_equation="88% metallurgical recovery"),
        
        # 3. Classify by grade
        CategoryFromThresholds(
            variable="Au_recovered",
            thresholds=[0.3, 1.0, 3.0],
            categories=["waste", "low_grade", "medium_grade", "high_grade"],
            name="ore_class",
            comment="Material classification"
        ),
    ])
    
    # Export to Leapfrog - done!
    calcset.to_lfcalc("resource_model.lfcalc")

**Compare this to manually creating 6+ calculations in Leapfrog's UI!** üéâ

.. note::
   This example creates 6 calculations that would take 10-15 minutes to build manually in Leapfrog. With pollywog, it takes seconds and is version-controlled, testable, and reusable!

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Core Functionality:**

- Read and write Leapfrog ``.lfcalc`` files
- Programmatically create calculations with ``Number``, ``Category``, ``Variable``, and ``Filter`` types
- Build conditional logic with ``If``/``Else`` statements
- Query and filter calculation sets like pandas DataFrames

**Helper Functions:**

- ``Sum``, ``Product``, ``Average`` - Basic mathematical operations
- ``WeightedAverage`` - Domain proportion weighting
- ``Scale``, ``Normalize`` - Data transformations
- ``CategoryFromThresholds`` - Threshold-based classification

**Machine Learning:**

- Convert scikit-learn decision trees to calculations
- Convert random forests to calculation ensembles
- Convert linear models to equations
- Full support for both regression and classification

**Advanced Features:**

- Topological sorting for dependency resolution
- Dependency analysis and visualization
- Interactive display in Jupyter notebooks
- Calculation validation and testing
