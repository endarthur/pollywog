Introduction
------------

**pollywog** is a Python library designed to make it easy to build, manipulate, and visually inspect Leapfrog-style calculation setsâ€”especially when those sets are large, complex, or involve repetitive logic.

What is Leapfrog?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Leapfrog is industry-leading 3D geological modeling and mine planning software developed by Seequent. It is widely used in mining and resource estimation for:

- Drillhole database management and visualization
- Geological modeling (surfaces, solids, block models)
- Grade estimation (kriging, IDW, nearest neighbor)
- Resource and reserve calculation
- Mine planning and design

Leapfrog uses **calculation sets** (.lfcalc files) to define formulas and transformations applied to data. These calculations can become complex when dealing with multiple domains, conditional logic, and multi-commodity resources.

Problems pollywog solves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Building large calculation sets:** Writing and maintaining hundreds of calculations by hand in Leapfrog can be error-prone and tedious. pollywog lets you generate, organize, and refactor these sets programmatically in Python.
- **Complicated logic:** Many workflows require conditional logic, grouping, and dependencies between variables. pollywog provides constructs like ``If`` blocks, ``Category`` grouping, and dependency analysis to help you manage complexity.
- **Repetitive tasks:** When you need to apply similar logic to many variables (e.g., clamping, scaling, filtering), pollywog enables you to automate these patterns with Python code, reducing manual effort and mistakes.
- **Visual inspection:** pollywog can render calculation sets as rich HTML trees in Jupyter, making it easy to review and debug logic before exporting to Leapfrog.
- **Machine learning integration:** Deploy scikit-learn models (decision trees, random forests, linear models) directly as Leapfrog calculations for predictive modeling.
- **Version control:** Keep calculation logic in Python scripts under Git version control for better traceability and collaboration.

By using pollywog, you can:

- Automate the creation and modification of calculation sets
- Refactor and query calculations with code
- Export directly to Leapfrog ``.lfcalc`` format
- Visualize and validate logic interactively in Jupyter notebooks
- Deploy machine learning models in your resource models
- Maintain calculation logic in version-controlled scripts

Quick Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a simple example showing pollywog's power:

.. code-block:: python

    from pollywog.core import CalcSet, Number
    from pollywog.helpers import WeightedAverage, CategoryFromThresholds
    
    # Create domain-weighted grade calculation
    calcset = CalcSet([
        # Weighted average across geological domains
        WeightedAverage(
            variables=["Au_oxide", "Au_sulfide", "Au_transition"],
            weights=["prop_oxide", "prop_sulfide", "prop_transition"],
            name="Au_composite"
        ),
        
        # Apply dilution and recovery
        Number(name="Au_diluted", children=["[Au_composite] * 0.95"]),
        Number(name="Au_recovered", children=["[Au_diluted] * 0.88"]),
        
        # Classify by grade
        CategoryFromThresholds(
            variable="Au_recovered",
            thresholds=[0.3, 1.0, 3.0],
            categories=["waste", "low_grade", "medium_grade", "high_grade"],
            name="ore_class"
        ),
    ])
    
    # Export to Leapfrog
    calcset.to_lfcalc("resource_model.lfcalc")

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Core Functionality:**

- Read and write Leapfrog ``.lfcalc`` files
- Programmatically create calculations with ``Number``, ``Category``, ``Variable``, and ``Filter`` types
- Build conditional logic with ``If``/``Else`` statements
- Query and filter calculation sets like pandas DataFrames

**Helper Functions:**

- ``Sum``, ``Product``, ``Average`` - Basic mathematical operations
- ``WeightedAverage`` - Domain proportion weighting
- ``Scale``, ``Normalize`` - Data transformations
- ``CategoryFromThresholds`` - Threshold-based classification

**Machine Learning:**

- Convert scikit-learn decision trees to calculations
- Convert random forests to calculation ensembles
- Convert linear models to equations
- Full support for both regression and classification

**Advanced Features:**

- Topological sorting for dependency resolution
- Dependency analysis and visualization
- Interactive display in Jupyter notebooks
- Calculation validation and testing
