## Test Quality Improvements

### 1. Better Coverage of Edge Cases
- Tests now cover edge cases like empty inputs, single-value inputs, negative values, and boundary conditions
- Error handling paths are now tested to ensure graceful degradation

### 2. Regression Prevention
- Integration tests ensure that complex workflows continue to work as expected
- File I/O tests ensure backward compatibility with .lfcalc files
- Serialization tests ensure data can be saved and restored correctly

### 3. Representative Test Cases
- Tests now include realistic use cases (e.g., mining workflows, grading systems)
- Tests cover both simple and complex scenarios
- Tests use meaningful variable names and realistic data

### 4. Test Coherence
- Tests are well-organized by module and functionality
- Each test has a clear purpose documented in docstrings
- Tests follow consistent patterns and naming conventions

## Known Limitations and Gaps

### 1. Uncovered Code
Some code remains uncovered due to:
- **display.py (53%)**: Display/rendering functions not fully tested (requires IPython environment simulation)
- **magics.py (27%)**: IPython magic commands (requires IPython kernel)
- **conversion/sklearn.py (57%)**: Some sklearn model types not tested
- **Bug-related code**: Some functions (min_, max_, abs, roundsf) have infinite recursion bugs that prevent testing

### 2. Areas for Future Improvement
- Add tests for display functions with mock IPython environment
- Add tests for IPython magic commands
- Add tests for more sklearn model types (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting)
- Add performance/stress tests for large calculation sets
- Add tests for concurrent/parallel execution scenarios

## Bugs Discovered During Testing

### 1. Infinite Recursion in Wrapper Functions ~~(FIXED)~~
**Location**: `pollywog/run.py`

~~Several wrapper functions have infinite recursion due to name collision with Python builtins:~~
- ~~`min()` calls `min_()` which calls builtin `min()` which calls wrapper `min()` again~~
- ~~`max()` has the same issue~~
- ~~`abs()` has the same issue~~
- ~~This breaks `clamp()`, `roundsf()`, and other functions that depend on them~~

**STATUS: FIXED** - These bugs have been resolved by using `builtins.min`, `builtins.max`, and `builtins.abs` in the underlying functions to avoid name collision. All affected functions (`min`, `max`, `abs`, `clamp`, `roundsf`) now work correctly.

### 2. Added `is_normal()` Function
**Location**: `pollywog/run.py`

Added new `is_normal()` function to check if a value is a valid finite number:
- Returns `True` for finite numbers (int, float)
- Returns `False` for `None`, `NaN`, or `infinity`
- Treats anything that isn't a normal number as NaN for run.py purposes
- Added to `LEAPFROG_ENV` for use in calculations

**Impact**: These functions cannot be used in calculations and tests cannot be written for them.

**Note**: These bugs existed before the test improvements and are not introduced by the test changes.

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **DONE**: Added comprehensive edge case tests
2. ✅ **DONE**: Added integration tests for complex workflows
3. ✅ **DONE**: Improved coverage from 70% to 74%

### 2. Future Actions
1. **Fix infinite recursion bugs** in run.py wrapper functions
2. **Add display function tests** with mocked IPython environment
3. **Add more sklearn model conversion tests** for ensemble methods
4. **Consider adding property-based tests** using hypothesis for better edge case coverage
5. **Add documentation tests** to ensure examples in docs are correct

## Conclusion

The test suite has been significantly improved with 42 new tests added (+72% increase), bringing total test count from 58 to 100. Coverage improved from 70% to 76% overall, with significant improvements in core.py (+5%) and run.py (+21%).

**Bug Fixes**: Fixed critical infinite recursion bugs in `min`, `max`, `abs`, `clamp`, and `roundsf` functions, and added the `is_normal` function for value validation.

The new tests are:
- **Representative**: They cover real-world use cases and workflows
- **Comprehensive**: They test both happy paths and edge cases
- **Coherent**: They follow consistent patterns and are well-documented
- **Regression-preventing**: They ensure existing functionality continues to work

The test suite now provides a solid foundation for preventing regressions and ensuring the reliability of the pollywog package.
